# Nottingham EEEBot Project ü§ñ

This project was completed as part of my first-year Electrical and Electronic Engineering course at the University of Nottingham.  
The aim was to design and build an autonomous robot vehicle capable of following a track and avoiding obstacles using embedded control systems.

---

## Project Overview
EEEBot was designed to navigate autonomously using sensors and a control algorithm implemented on an ESP32 microcontroller.  
The system used sensor data to detect lines, measure distance, and adjust motor speeds in real time.

## Key Components
- 2x ESP32 + Raspberry Pi
- IR Array sensors
- Ultrasonic distance sensor + IMU
- DC motors + servo + chassis 
- Battery power system

---

## What I did
- PCB for the chassis of EEEBot was given but it was barebones so I sordered the components and positioned the sensors 
- Designed and soldered circuit for IR sensor array on vero board for line following 
- Programmed control logic (line following and obstacle avoidance)
- Used webcam and raspberry pi with node red to create manual web app control and OpenCV to do image recogntion 
- Created wiring and block diagrams  
- Conducted testing and performance tuning

## üéØ Results
- The robot managed to follow a course with black lines and a maze with both manual web app control and image recognition 
- Demonstrated stable motor control and obstacle detection  
- Achieved consistent performance under test conditions

## üß∞ Skills Gained
- C programming (Raspberry Pi / ESP32)  
- Circuit design and sensor integration  
- PID control system tuning  
- Troubleshoot hardware and debug code
- Computer vision with OpenCV
